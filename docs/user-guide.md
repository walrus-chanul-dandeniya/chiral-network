2. Enter peer multiaddress or ID
3. Click "Connect"

### NAT Traversal

**Check reachability**:
- View NAT status in Network page
- Public/Private/Unknown indicator
- Confidence level

**If behind NAT**:
- AutoRelay will automatically find relay nodes
- Or manually add relays in Relay page

## Using Relay Nodes

### As a Client (Using Relays)

If you're behind NAT:

1. **Navigate to Relay page**
2. **Enable AutoRelay** (enabled by default)
3. **Optionally add preferred relays**:
   - Enter multiaddress of trusted relay
   - One per line
4. **System will automatically**:
   - Discover available relays
   - Reserve relay slots
   - Route connections through relays

### As a Server (Running Relay)

Help other NAT'd peers:

1. **Navigate to Relay page**
2. **Click "Enable Relay Server"**
3. **DHT restarts** with relay mode enabled
4. **Monitor relay reputation** in Reputation page
5. **Earn reputation** by helping peers

**Requirements**:
- Good uptime
- Stable connection
- Sufficient bandwidth
- DHT must be running

## Mining

### Start Mining

1. **Navigate to Mining page**
2. **Configure settings**:
   - **Threads**: Number of CPU cores to use (1-16)
   - **Intensity**: CPU usage percentage (1-100%)

3. **Click "Start Mining"**
4. **Monitor performance**:
   - Hash rate (H/s, KH/s, MH/s)
   - Blocks found
   - Total rewards

### Mining Tips

**Optimization**:
- Use all available CPU cores for maximum hashrate
- Start with 50% intensity and adjust based on system performance
- Close unnecessary applications
- Monitor CPU temperature

**Economics**:
- Calculate electricity costs vs. rewards
- Solo mining may have irregular rewards
- Pool mining (coming soon) offers consistent payouts
